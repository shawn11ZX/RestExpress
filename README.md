[![Build Status](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/RestExpress/job/RestExpress/badge/icon)](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/RestExpress/job/RestExpress/)

RestExpress is a thin wrapper on the JBOSS Netty HTTP stack to provide a simple and easy way to
create RESTful services in Java that support massive Internet Scale and performance.

Born to be simple, only three things are required to wire up a service:
1) The main class which utilizes the RestExpress DSL to create a server instance.
2) A RouteDeclaration extender (much like routes.rb in a Rails app), which uses a DSL for the
   declaration of supported URLs and HTTP methods of the service(s) in its defineRoutes() method.
3) Service implementation(s), which is/are a simple POJO--no interface or super class
   implementation.

See: examples/kickstart directory to get started (there is a README there).

RestExpress supports both JSEND-style and raw responses.  Meaning that it can wrap responses so
AJAX clients can always process the responses easily.  Or it can simply marshal the service return
value directly into JSON or XML.  For more information on JSEND-style responses, see:
http://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend

     </profile>
  </profiles>
```

===================================================================================================
## A quick tutorial:

Please see the Kickstart application in examples/kickstart for a complete, running example.

* HTTP Methods, if not changed in the fluent (DSL) interface, map to the following:
	* GET --> read(Request, Response)
	* PUT --> update(Request, Response)
	* POST --> create(Request, Response)
	* DELETE --> delete(Request, Response)

* You can choose to return objects from the methods, if desired, which will be returned to the client in the body of the response.  The object will be marshaled into JSON or XML, depending on the default or based on the format in the request (e.g. '.xml' or '?format=xml').

* If you choose to not return a value from the method (void methods) and using raw responses, then call response.setResponseNoContent() before returning to set the response HTTP status code to 204 (no content).  Wrapped responses (JSEND style) are the default.  So if you're using wrapped responses, there will always be a response returned to the client--therefore, you don't need to set the response.setResponseNoContent().  Just return your objects--or not.  RestExpress will handle things on your behalf!

* On successful creation, call response.setResponseCreated() to set the returning HTTP status code to 201.

* For more real-world examples, see the examples/ directory which contains additional projects that setup RestExpress services.  Simply do '**ant run**' to run them.  Then to see what's available perform a GET on the route: '/routes/metadata' to get a list of all the routes (or endpoints) available (e.g. localhost:8000/routes/metadata in the browser).

===================================================================================================
BTW, if you're on a Mac or Linux box, you can do the following to get Ruby on Rails "scaffolding"
-like behavior by running the following from the RestExpress root directory:
1) ant release
2) ./src/scripts/install.sh
3) cd <a new directory> (e.g. '~/src')
4) <restexpress home>/src/scripts/restexpress.sh <name of project> (e.g. Sample)
5) cd <new project directory> (e.g. Sample)
6) ant run

From another console, enter something like the following to test your new service suite:
1) curl -i localhost:8081/sample/42

You should see something like this:
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 115

{"code":404,"status":"error","message":"The order ID you requested was not found: 42","data":"NotFoundException"}

===================================================================================================
Change History/Release Notes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 0.9.0 - SNAPSHOT (in branch 'master')
* BREAKING CHANGE: eliminated GSON. RestExpress now uses Jackson for JSON processing.
  The changes are localized to the 'serialization' package.  Simply copy the ObjectIdDeserializer,
  ObjectIdSerializer and JsonSerializationProcessor from https://github.com/RestExpress/RestExpress-Scaffold/tree/master/mongodb/src/main/java/com/strategicgains/restexpress/scaffold/mongodb/serialization
  for MongoDB-based projects.  Or just the JsonSerializationProcessor from https://github.com/RestExpress/RestExpress-Scaffold/tree/master/minimal/src/main/java/com/strategicgains/restexpress/scaffold/minimal/serialization
  for a minimal project.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed Chunking and compression settings. RestExpress does not support
  chunking/streaming uploads.  So the setting were superfluous.  The facility is still there
  to support streaming downloads, however, and these will be chunked as necessary. As compression
  is based on the Accept header, support is always provided--settings are superfluous.
  NOTE: streaming downloads are not fully implemented yet.

Release 0.8.2 - 19 Feb 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed issue in Request.parseQueryString() to URL decode query-string parameters before putting
  them in the Request header.

Release 0.8.1 - 16 Jan 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed Ant-build artifacts.
* Extracted Query-related classes into RestExpress-Common.
* Fixed maven compile plugin to generate Java target and source for 1.6
* Updated Netty dependency to 3.6.2.Final
* Removed dependency on HyperExpress.

Release 0.8.0 - 09 Jan 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Pushed to Maven Central repository.
* Introduced maven build.
* Merged pull request #49 - Added method to get all headers from a HttpRequest.
* Fixed issue #40 (https://github.com/RestExpress/RestExpress/issues/40).
* Introduced route 'aliases' where there are multiple URLs for a given service.
* Introduced concept of "finally" processors, which are executed in the finally block of
  DefaultRequestHandler and all of them are executed even if an exception is thrown within one
  of them.  This enable the CorsHeaderPlugin to set the appropriate header even on not found
  errors, etc.
* Changed to support multiple response types with wrapping or not, etc. Now can support wrapped
  JSON (.wjson) and XML (.wxml) as well as un-wrapped JSON (.json) and XML (.xml) depending on the
  format specifier.
* Now throws BadRequestException (400) if the specified format (e.f. .json) isn't supported by the 
  service suite.
* Now throws MethodNotAllowedException (405) if the requested URL matches a route but not for the
  requested HTTP method.  Sets the HTTP Allow header to a comma-delimited list of accepted methods.
* Removed StringUtils.parseQueryString() as it was previously deprecated--use QueryStringParser.
* Introduced String.join() methods (2).
* Removed JSONP handling, favoring use of CORS instead, introducing CorsHeaderPlugin and corresponding post-processor.
* Wraps ETAG header in quotes.
* Renamed QueryRange.stop to QueryRange.limit.
* Removed need for RouteDefinition class, moving that functionality into the RestExpress builder.
* Changed example apps to reflect above elimination of RouteDefinition class.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.7.4 - 30 Nov 2012 (branch 'v0.7.4')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Patch release to allow period ('.') as a valid character within URL parameters. Note that this
  now allows a period to be the last character on the URL whether there is a format-specifier
  parameter declared for that route, or not. Also, if the route supports the format specifier and
  there is a period in the last parameter of the URL, anything after the last period will be used
  as the format for the request--which may NOT be what you want.
  -- /foo/todd.fredrich --> /foo/{p1}.{format} will use 'fredrich' as the format
  -- /foo/todd.fredrich.json --> /foo/{p1}.{format} will use 'json' as the format
  -- /foo/todd. --> /foo/{p1}.{format} will contain 'todd.' for the value of p1
  -- /foo/todd. --> /foo/{p1} will contain 'todd.' for the value of p1

===================================================================================================
Release 0.7.3 - 12 July 2012 (branch 'v0.7.3')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Patch release to fix an issue with i18n. Fixed issue with
  DefaultJsonProcessor.deserialize(ChannelBuffer, Class) where underlying InputStreamReader was
  not UTF-8.

==================================================================================================
Release 0.7.2 - 14 May 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Introduced ExecutionHandler with configuration via RestExpress.setExecutorThreadCount(int)
  to off-load long-running requests from the NIO workers into a separate thread pool.
* Introduced CacheControlPlugin which leverages CacheHeaderPostprocessor, DateHeaderPostprocessor
  and EtagHeaderPostprocessor to respond to GET requests.
* Introduced EtagHeaderPostprocessor which adds ETag header in response to GET requests.
* Introduced DateHeaderPostprocessor which adds a Date header to responses to GET requests.
* Introduced CacheHeaderPostprocessor which support Cache-Control and other caching-related
  response header best-practices by setting Parameters.Cache.MAX_AGE or Flags.Cache.DONT_CACHE on
  a route.
* Changed to use QueryStringParser over StringUtils for query-string and QueryStringDecoder for 
  body parsing. This mitigates HashDoS attacks, since the query-string is parsed before a request
  is accepted.
* Deprecated StringUtils in favor of using Netty's QueryStringDecoder or 
  RestExpress's QueryStringParser.
* Refactored so SerializationProcessor.resolve(Request) is only called once at the end of the
  request cycle (performance enhancement).

===================================================================================================
Release 0.7.1 - 20 Sep 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added rootCause to ResultWrapper data area.
* Exposed the XStream object from DefaultXmlProcessor.
* Renamed Link to XLink.
* Renamed LinkUtils to XLinkUtils, adding asXLinks() method that utilizes XLinkFactory callback
  to create the XLink instances.
* Changed URL Matching to support additional characters: '[', ']', '&' which more closely follows
  W3C the specification.
* Added ability to return query string parameters as a Map from the Request.
* Introduced Request.getBaseUrl() which returns protocol and host, without URL path information.
* Introduced query criteria capability: filter, order, range (for pagination).
* Introduced the concept of Plugins.
* Refactored the console routes to use the new plugin concept.
* Updated Netty jars (to 3.2.5).
* Added ability to set the number of worker threads via call to RestExpress.setWorkerThreadCount()
  before calling bind().

===================================================================================================
Release 0.7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added gzip request/response handling. On by default. Disable it via call to
  RestExpress.noCompression() and supportCompression().
* Added chunked message handling. On by default. Chunking settings are managed via
  RestExpress.noChunkingSupport(), supportChunking(), and setMaxChunkSize(int).

===================================================================================================
Release 0.6.1.1 - 31 Mar 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug fix to patch erroneously writing to already closed channel in
  DefaultRequestHandler.exceptionCaught().

===================================================================================================
Release 0.6.1 - 30 Mar 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Stability release.
* Fixed issue when unable to URL Decode query string parameters or URL.
* Introduced SerializationResolver that defines a getDefault() method. Implemented
  SerializationResolver in DefaultSerializationResolver.
* Changed UrlPattern to match format based on non-whitespace vs. word characters.
* Refactored Request.getHeader() into getRawHeader(String) and getUrlDecodedHeader(String), along
  with corresponding getRawHeader(String,String) and getUrlDecodedHeader(String,String).
* Renamed realMethod property to effectiveHttpMethod, along with appropriate accessor/mutator.
* Removed Request from Response constructor signature.
* Added FieldNamingPolicy to DefaultJsonProcessor (using LOWER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES).
* getUrlDecodedHeader(String) throws BadRequestException if URL decoding fails.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.6.0.2 - 21 Mar 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed issue with 'connection reset by peer' causing unresponsive behavior.
* Utilized Netty logging behavior to add logging capabilities to RestExpress.
* Made socket-level settings externally configurable:  tcpNoDelay, KeepAlive, reuseAddress,
  soLinger, connectTimeoutMillis, receiveBufferSize.
* Merged in 0.5.6.1 path release changes.
* Added enforcement of some HTTP 1.1 specification rules: Content-Type, Content-Length and body
  content for 1xx, 204, 304 are not allow.  Now throws HttpSpecificationException if spec. is
  not honored.
* Added ability to add 'flags' and 'parameters' to routes, in that, uri().flag("name") on Route
  makes test request.isFlagged("name") return true. Also, uri().parameter("name", "value")
  makes request.getParamater("name") return "value". Not returned/marshaled in the response.
  Useful for setting internal values/flags for preprocessors, controllers, etc.
* Added .useRawResponse() and .useWrappedResponse() to fluent route DSL.  Causes that particular
  route to wrap the response or not, independent of global response wrap settings.
* Parameters parsed from the URL and query string arguments are URL decoded before being placed
  as Request headers.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.6.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Issue #7 - Fixed issue with invalid URL requested where serialization always occurred to the
             default (JSON).  Now serializes to the requested format, if applicable.
* Issue #11 - Feature enhancement for Kickstart.  Now utilizes Rails-inspired configuration
              environements (e.g. dev, testing, prod, etc.).
* Issue #12 - Parse URL parameter names out of the URL pattern and include them in the route
              metadata output.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Routes now defined in descendant of RouteDeclaration.
* Refactored everything into RestExpress object, using builder pattern for configuration.
* Implemented RestExpress DSL to declare REST server in main().
* Added supported formats and default format to RouteBuilder.
* Added JSEND-style response wrapping (now default).  Call RestExpress.useWrappedResponses() to use.
* Add ability to support raw response return.  Call RestExpress.useRawResponses() to use.
* Implemented /console/routes.{format} route which return metadata about the routes in this
  service suite. To use, call RestExpress.supportConsoleRoutes().
* Exceptions occurring now return in the requested format with the message wrapped and using the
  appropriate mime type (e.g. application/json or application/xml).
* Kickstart application has complete build with 'dist' target that builds a runnable jar file and
  'run' target that will run the services from the command line.
* Kickstart application now handles JVM shutdown correctly using JVM shutdown hooks.  The method
  RestExpress.awaitShutdown() uses the DefaultShutdownHook class.  RestExpress.shutdown() allows
  programs to use their own shutdown hooks, calling RestExpress.shutdown() upon shudown to release
  all resource.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.6.1 - 11 Mar 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Patch release to fix issue with HTTP response status of 204 (No Content) and 304 (Not Modified)
  where they would return a body of an empty string and content length of 2 ('\r\n').  No longer
  serializes for 204 or 304.  Also no longer serializes for null body response unless a JSONP header
  is passed in on the query string.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.6 - 18 Jan 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Upgraded to Netty 3.2.3 final.
* Added getProtocol(), getHost(), getPath() to Request
* Functionality of getUrl() is now getPath() and getUrl() now returns the entire URL string,
  including protocol, host and port, and path.

===================================================================================================

* Added SimpleMessageObserver which performs simple timings and outputs to System.out.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added alias() capability to DefaultTxtProcessor to facilitate custom text serialization.
* Updated kickstart application to illustrate latest features.
* Minor refactoring of constants and their locations (moved to RestExpress.java).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed issue with JSON date/timestamp parsing.
* Fixed issues with XML date/timestamp parsing.
* Upgraded to GSON 1.6 release.
* Added correlation ID to Request to facilitate timing, etc. in pipeline.
* Added alias(String, Class) to DefaultXmlProcessor.
* By default, alias List and Link in DefaultXmlProcessor.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Introduced DateJsonProcessor (sibling to DefaultJsonProcessor) which parses dates vs. time points.
* Refactored ExceptionMapping.getExceptionFor() signature from Exception to Throwable.
* Introduced MessageObserver, which accepts notifications of onReceived(), onSuccess(), onException(), onComplete() to facilitate logging, auditing, timing, etc.
* Changed RouteResolver.resolve() to throw NotFoundException instead of BadRequestException for unresolvable URI.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Enhanced support for mark, unreserved and some reserved characters in URL. Specifically, added
  $-+*()~:!' and %.  Still doesn't parse URLs with '.' within the string itself--because of the
  support for .{format} URL section.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Renamed repository from RestX to RestExpress.
* Repackaged everything from com.strategicgains.restx... to com.strategicgains.restexpress...

* Can now create route mappings for OPTIONS and HEAD http methods.
* Added decoding to URL when Request is constructed.
* Improved pre-processor implementation, including access to resolved route in request.
* Better null handling here and there to avoid NullPointerException, including serialization resolver.
* Improved UT coverage.
* KickStart application builds and is a more accurate template.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.3
